## FAQ

#### 1) Is this an official college-approved webapp?

No, this is a personal experimental project and is not approved/supported by any kind of institue authorities.

#### 2) Will i get full marks if i write answers from the generated PDF?

No, we do NOT guarantee you full marks. No teacher gives out full marks easily even if you write from the textbook itself.

#### 3) Does this AI generate diagrams/images in the PDF?

As of now, our webapp does NOT include any kind of graphical content (including diagrams and images) in the generated PDF.

#### 4) What are Phoenix's thoughts about this?

Well, does it matter? As we all know Phoenix's E ability (fireball) is to heal himself and damaging others around. In the similar way, for his own 'academic' satisfaction, he makes us suffer... JUST KIDDING! HAH!
